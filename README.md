# LLM-application-to-generate-Mobile-UI-Designs
The goal of this project is to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) program that can produce mobile user interface designs. Based on user-provided text inputs, the application creates user interface (UI) graphics using Stable Diffusion for computer vision and a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language processing.
